Description of my project

This present project shows as how much distance a driver has made during travel and the level of fuel he has for the rest of the travel.

The objective is that if the driver passes the 200 kilometers he must take a break to avoid tiredness and accident.
Else he can continue till 200 kilometers if the fuel level is over 50%.

For the break during the travel there is a proposal of distraction like video that he can watch. the video can be personalized as he wants.
